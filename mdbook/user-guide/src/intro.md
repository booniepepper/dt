# dt: duct tape for Unix pipes

dt is a utility and programming language.

The utility `dt` is intended for ergonomic in-the-shell execution. It is a
supplement to many other fantastic tools like awk, sed, xargs, among many
other programs and shell built-in functions.

The language dt is a straightforward (in a very literal sense) functional
concatenative language with minimal syntax that allows for high-level, and even
higher-order, programming.


## Goals

dt's goals, in the context of Unix-like environments:

1. Be easy to use and understand
2. Be useful
3. Be fast
