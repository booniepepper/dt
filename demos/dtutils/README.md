## dtutils

A set of demo scripts showcasing common [POSIX utilities][util]
([full reference][posix]), and other common utilities present in software
suites like GNU coreutils, busybox, etc.

These scripts do not have a goal of being as-performant as implementations in
C or other similar languages.

If anyone is interested in fleshing these out, feel free to send a PR!
