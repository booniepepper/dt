# Excuse me, is it "duct" or "duck" tape?

The original name is "duck tape" and refers to the "duck cloth" under the
adhesive.

The far more common name these days is "duct tape" and most but not all of the
references in dt documentation will use this term. As far as I can tell, the
etymology here is a misspelling that caught on. The most popular tape for
actual ducts uses aluminum.

To confuse things even more there's also a product out there called "Duck
TapeÂ® Brand Duct Tape." This is not an advertisement or endorsement, but they
do have a pretty cool [history page](https://www.duckbrand.com/about).

## Vesta Stoudt

[Vesta Stoudt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_Stoudt), who was 51 years
old, and a mother of 8 at the time, is credited with popularizing the most
common form of duck tape that we know and love today. She was sure she had a
great solution for sealing ammunition boxes that could also be easily ripped
open. Her bosses didn't do anything where her suggestion, so she mailed
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and he _did_.

Vesta's pragmatic initiative is an inspiration for what dt can be.

Johnson and Johnson have [a great article on Mrs. Stoudt](https://www.jnj.com/our-heritage/vesta-stoudt-the-woman-who-invented-duct-tape)
as part of their heritage articles.

## Red Green

There are many references to [Red Green](https://www.redgreen.com) throughout
the dt project, and his handyman wisdom has helped shape this project. Quotes
are included in the project with permission from Sam Smith.

Red Green knows the handyman's secret weapon is duct tape. Watching
[Handyman Corner](https://redgreen.fandom.com/wiki/Handyman_Corner) as a child,
I (J.R.) saw duct tape used for everything from repairing pants and fixing
spare tires up to jet packs and the creation of a "Hummer" by duct taping two
partial vehicles to each other... Some of these projects even lasted longer
than the segment! This has surely influenced the design of dt in ways I might
not be able to articulate.

> Red Green is not the only connection to red and green, it's also a reference
to Chuck Moore's <span style="color: red;">color</span><span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Forth</span>
programming language. Unlike <span style="color: red;">color</span><span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Forth</span>,
dt does not have any syntactic or semantic meaning for the colors and only ever
uses them as decoration when printing information. To support the colorblind,
dt always treats green as bold.

## Other duct-tape-related software

Just like there's not just one brand of duct tape, dt is not the only software
with a duct tape theme, and not nearly the first. Here are some others:

* [Duktape](https://duktape.org): An embeddable Javascript engine.
* [Ducttape](https://github.com/jhclark/ducttape): A workflow management system
  for researchers who love Unix.
* [DuctTape](https://ducttape.sourceforge.net/): A build system for Half Life 2
  modders.
* [Duct Tape Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2122680/Duct_Tape_Simulator/):
  A game where you _are_ duct tape and go fix things. Games are software! I'll
  have to give it a try.

I'll have to give these a try some day. Should dt ever use these...? Maybe, it
does sound like there might be some kindred spirits out there.

> As a bonus, Joel Spolsky has written about
[_The Duct Tape Programmer_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/)
and I think it captures some of the ethos for why I wanted dt to exist and what
I wanted it to encourage.
