# Duct Tape

## Excuse me, is it "duct" or "duck" tape?

The original name is "duck tape" and refers to the "duck cloth" under the
adhesive.

The far more common name these days is "duct tape" and most but not all of the
references in dt documentation will use this term. As far as I can tell, the
etymology here is a misspelling that caught on. The most popular tape for
actual ducts uses aluminum.

To confuse things even more there's also a product out there called "Duck
TapeÂ® Brand Duct Tape." This is not an advertisement or endorsement, but they
do have a pretty cool [history page](https://www.duckbrand.com/about).

## Vesta Stoudt

[Vesta Stoudt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_Stoudt), who was 51 years
old, and a mother of 8 at the time, is credited with popularizing the most
common form of duck tape that we know and love today. She was sure she had a
great solution for sealing ammunition boxes that could also be easily ripped
open. Her bosses didn't do anything where her suggestion, so she mailed
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and he _did_.

Vesta's pragmatic initiative is an inspiration for what dt can be.

## Red Green

There are many references to [Red Green](https://www.redgreen.com) throughout
the dt project, and his handyman wisdom has helped shape this project. Quotes
are included in the project with permission from Sam Smith.

Red Green is not the only connection to red and green, it also is a reference
to Chuck Moore's <span style="color: red;">color</span><span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Forth</span>
programming language. Unlike <span style="color: red;">color</span><span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Forth</span>,
dt does not have any syntactic or semantic meaning for the colors and only ever
uses them as decoration when printing information. To support the colorblind,
dt always treats green as bold.
